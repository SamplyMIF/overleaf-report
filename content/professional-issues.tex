\chapter{Professional Issues}
\label{ch:professional-issues}
The project aims to meet the standards set in the BCS Code of Conduct issues by the British Computing Society. 
\subsection*{Public Interest}
This section is concerned with the well-being and protection of third-party rights, and with fairness in avoiding discrimination. These standards are fully met, as the project had no third-party involvement.
\subsection*{Professional Competence and Integrity}
This section outlines behaviour in avoiding overestimation of one's abilities, striving for constant improvement and respecting alternate viewpoints or criticism. The knowledge base that was acquired during the development phase is far superior to what it was when the project started. This was a result of constant learning and researching, but was also a result of criticism and advice from the supervisors of this project.
\subsection*{Duty to Relevant Authority}
The project carries all its duties and requirements imposed by the primary body of authority, the University of Liverpool, and its representative and primary supervisor, Dr Vitaliy Kurlin. No information regarding the finished program is withheld, the program being presented in its entirety in this document.
