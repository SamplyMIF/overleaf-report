\section{Synthetic Data}

% Ignore this for now
For the input data, several entries from the Cambridge Structural Database
were used. For testing, Iâ€™ve made use of Mercury, a visualisation tool for
crystal structures that works in unison with the CSD. To use Mercury and
access the CSD as a resource, a license is required. For the purpose of this
project, I have been granted a license by Dr Vitaliy Kurlin from the University
of Liverpool. As integration with the CSD has not been achieved in time, the
user does not require a license for the CSD to utilise the project, with the
exception if they choose to use it as a means of extracting crystalline material
data. In that event, a license will still be required. \\
A lot of caution has been utilised when selecting 3rd party libraries, and
all used have been check and proven to be open-source. No further user
attention is required as the program comes packed with all the required
library files under a Dynamic-Linked Library (DLL) format. \\
