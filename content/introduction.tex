\section{Problem addressed}

\section{Aims and Objectives}
The aim of this project is to create a system capable of calculating, storing and predicting formulae of chemical compounds given a set of precursors, with a focus on optimization and finding an acceptable solution within a given set of bounds. The program is designed to be remotely accessible, with a web server providing a user front end and a space for necessary calculations, and a database for the purposes of storing chemical data and user account information. \\

The project will primarily use C++ for computation, NodeJS with several popular packages for the web server and user interface, and MongoDB for the database system. \\

This project is produced in conjunction with the Materials Innovation Factory and is intended for their use. The development and evaluation of the project will be performed in cooperation with the facility. \\

This project is mainly based on the prior research topics and problems encountered by researchers in the MIF, for example having a person test possible compounds and slowly refine the formula based on their results is a time and material inefficient process, therefore if we can suggest compounds which are either direct results or very close approximations to their desired outcome then this process can be minimised. \\

\subsection{Ethical Use Of Human Participants}
As with one of our undergraduate projects data from members of the project group does not constitute 3rd party evaluation, and with non-project team members we will be strictly following the CS Department ethical procedure for MEng project 3rd party evaluation. All other data used in the project is well known public data regarding the behaviour of elements. \\

We believe the combination of these factors allows us to proceed without further application for research ethics approval.
