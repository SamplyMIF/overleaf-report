In this project we aim to aid chemists in the Material Innovation Factory by computing viable combinations of chemical precursors to produce a given stoichiometry. Currently this process is done by hand with an amount of guess work as the ratios are refined, we believe that we can accelerate this process by directly calculating the ratios they are trying to find. \\

Our proposed method uses linear algebra to solve a set of constraint equations that define the precursors and the desired outcome. However the set of equations may be incomplete therefore there is not a single solution, instead an infinite space of solutions which we must select the most relevant and useful points from, we propose a scoring system to help identify the best points in the space. \\

For optimum availability the system is accessible online via a web server and accompanying database. This section of the project also presents novel challenges as we integrate multiple programming languages and paradigms in an asynchronous environment. Our resulting system is in its early usable state however future work needs to be done to move it into a state where it is feature complete.
